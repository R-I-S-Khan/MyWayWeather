# My Way Weather

## Description of Project

Travellers need to know the weather along the route that they need to take. This application provides the travellers with relevant weather information in the route that they are going to take.

## User Story

- User will enter the location of his/her place(Origin) and the location of the place that he/she wants to go (Desination).
- The application will then show the user the route along that he has to take to reach his/her destination.
- User will get the option of displaying weather in different locations that are in his route.[Show Points button].
- User will get the option of hiding weather information in different locations that are in his route to just visualize only the route that he has to take
- The different weather points in his/her route will be shown with markers.
- The user will be able to obtain relevant information about the weather in the points where the markers
  are situated along with the country,state and city that the marker is located at.
